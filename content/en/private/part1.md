### Grading guidelines

Two options to run student projects after downloading them using github classroom assistant:

#### 1. Use PyCharm Professional
- Gives you point and click interface for easy access
- Download [PyCharm Professional](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=mac)
- Apply for [academic licenses and wait for approval](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students) 
- Do Not Use PyCharm Edu as it does not support Django


#### 2. USe The Command Line
- Quick, easy, and free if you are familiar with command line
- Use CMD for windows or terminal for mc
- Change the working directory to the directory containing the student's work
- Run the project:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
- Open the Browser to the development server URL shown on the command line screen
