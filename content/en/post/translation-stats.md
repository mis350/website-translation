My students in 350 did a great job in assisting in translating this website's content to Arabic.


Here are the contributions shown as a pie chart:

Do not forget that you have until the final to contribute a translation. The bonus grades you get for participation will be based on how much you contribute. It goes without saying, if you try to game the system, you forfeit your right to receive any bonus points for this course.

I hope everyone found this task to be a great opportunity to learn how to use Git/GitHub and an opportunity to build their collaboration skills. Hopefully, this is the first contributions of many to come from the students.

A job well done!
